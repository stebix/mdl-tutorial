# mdl-tutorial
Educational material for the machine learning and deep learning tutorial course.
In this course, we want to cover the following topics:

- introduce the foundations of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
- introduce the deep neural network as one model class inside the supervised learning paradigm
- provide an overview of existing Python-based libraries that target deep learning workloads
- delve into PyTorch as a framework
- implement a solution to a toy deep learning problem
  - set up data loading
  - implement multiple toy models
  - write the core training loop and watch our network learn :)
